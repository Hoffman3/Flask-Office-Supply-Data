## **Setup Instructions:**

## **1. Clone git repository to IDE:**
When using PyCharm Navigate to clone repository and copy and paste the github URL below or in your search bar, for other IDE's search for similar clone repositories using git or utilize the terminal with the code in the second instructions.
```bash
https://github.com/Hoffman3/Flask-Office-Supply-Data.git
```
## **2. Clone the Repository using terminal:**
locate the terminal on your IDE and copy and paste the following then add files to main project directory
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hoffman3/Flask-Office-Supply-Data.git
```
## **3.Create and activate virutal environment:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
Windows:

## **3. Run the following command using terminal to install required Python libraries:**
```bash
